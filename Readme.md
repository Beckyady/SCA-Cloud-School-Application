This contains the instructions used for the deployment of the project

step 1: After the image has been built and the container has been created.

step 2. I went to docker hub to create an account and then created a repository called "sca-cloud-school"

step 3: My container wasn't tagged before, so i ran the command "docker tag imageid newtagname/name:version"

eg "docker tag 4ab605db0d70  beckyady/sca-cloud-school:v.10"

step 4: then "docker push beckyady/sca-cloud-school "
